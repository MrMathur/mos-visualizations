        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p>The third visualization is what is known as a unit visualization. It is named so because every character from
          the video is represented by a spherical unit. Different attributes of this unit encode different
          characteristics. Here, the area covered by the outer and inner circles represent the number of total words and
          also questions uttered by each student and the teacher during this sequence of interaction.

        <h2>Encoding Decisions</h2>
        <p>A database was generated with each individual, the word count for each individual, and the question word
          count for each individual. Notably, expressions and exclamations were not included in word counts for each
          individual. A distinction between a statement and question was made by judging the intonation of the dialogue,
          with the intent being to explore the role and significance of questioning in the classroom. With the database
          in place, a unit visualization was created. The area of the lighter circle indicates the total word count for
          each individual whereas the area of each darker circle indicates the question word count for each individual
          (as represented by the legend). Importantly, area (as opposed to the use of radius) was selected to encode
          total and question word counts because the consensus in the visualization community is to use area, as it is a
          more intuitive indicator of quantity. The x position of each individual is determined by one of three modes or
          orders selected by the user.

        <h2>Insights Generated</h2>
        <p> The visualization supports comparative analysis across individual speakers with respect to the number of
          words uttered and the number of questions posed. For example, the teacher speaks many more words and also a
          far larger number of questions whereas students have much lower word counts and fewer questions. The
          visualization makes evident differences in contributions between students. For example, the visualization
          highlights child 1 as a significant speaker in the classroom; Notably, she also asks the teacher the largest
          number of questions. Altogether, the visualization is quite useful to analyze conversational parity or whether
          there are equitable opportunities to talk. However, the coherence and meaning of conversation are
          backgrounded.
