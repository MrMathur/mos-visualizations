        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p>The first visualization is what is known as a lollipop chart, which is an extension of the more widely known
          bar chart. In this case, the length of each horizontal line across the X-axis encodes the number of times a
          word has been spoken during the 2-minute video of classroom interaction. Moreover, the chart supports standard
          forms of user interaction in two ways: Sorting and hovering (see Yi et al., 2007). Namely, the words can be
          sorted in ascending or descending order by using a button while hovering over each circle also reveals the
          sentences in which the word was spoken and allows users to view and read these sentences.

        <h2>Encoding Decisions</h2>
        <p>A database (i.e., a .csv file) was generated with each word, its frequency, and the sentences during which
          these words were spoken. Conversation spoken by teachers and students during this sequence of interaction was
          occasionally in spanish. The authors decided to only use the english translation of words in the video.
          Notably, articles and pronouns were also not included. With the database in place, a lollipop chart was made,
          by encoding the x position of the circle as the word length, and the y-axis as the rank (either ascending or
          descending, on the basis of the user’s selection). A lollipop chart was used as opposed to a more standard bar
          chart because a lollipop chart affords more ways for users to interact with the data, in this case by reading
          sentences from which each word was derived.

        <h2>Insights Generated</h2>
        <p>Many basic insights are visible through this simple, standard representation. For example, while the central
          topic of this sequence of classroom interaction is the notion that “matter occupies space”, those particular
          words are rarely spoken by the teacher or students. In contrast, metaphors such as CocaCola, Sand, Bubbles,
          and Dancing are repeatedly uttered. A few student names are also recurrent, however not all student names are
          spoken. Furthermore, the possibilities to interact with this visualization allow users to consider the context
          in which each utterance is spoken at a sentence level offering very different ways to read turns of talk in
          comparison to traditional, non-interactive transcription methods. These possibilities are in accordance with
          Schneiderman’s visualization mantra stating a visualization should first provide an overview description, and
          subsequently, provide “details on demand” through user interaction such as hovering or filtering (Shneiderman,
          1996). However, many insights are also lost through this type of representation in comparison to a more
          traditional transcript. For example, coherence of participants’ sense-making is difficult to recover even
          through interaction.</p>
