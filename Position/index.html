        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p>The chart is a position and gaze diagram, where each dot is positioned according to a character's pixel
          values in the video, and the line represents the gaze of the character, at any instant of time. The users can
          use the provided time slider to observe the positions and gaze at specific intervals of time while filtering
          capabilities via checkboxes allow users to selectively view each individual’s position and gize and also
          simplify the visualization.

        <h2>Encoding Decisions</h2>
        <p>To deal with the complexity and size of data, 5 second intervals were chosen. Moreover, pixel values from the
          video were used to indicate the position of the character, as opposed to a bird’s eye view of the room.
          Likewise, the gaze in the video is in 3D space. However, the gaze was mapped in 2D space, because of the two
          dimensional nature of a video. The gaze was defined as the line between every student (and teacher ), and the
          point at which the field of view intersected with the screen’s boundary. A database was generated with 5
          second intervals, the pixel values for each character’s head position, and the pixel values for the point at
          which their gaze intersects with the boundary of the screen. Circles were plotted at the pixel values of the
          head, and a line was generated from the head to the gaze point. Each character was color coded to identify the
          circle. Since there are 11 categories, a standard rule in information visualization called the Magic Number 7
          rule dictates that color is not an appropriate encoding for this visualization. However, the interactive
          filtering technique permits us to break this rule, with the hope that users would not compare more than 9
          values at once through the visualization.

        <h2>Insights Generated</h2>
        <p>The visualization indicates aspects of how the teacher, individual students, and the class collectively focus
          and manage their attention or, in other words, how gaze is recruited and allocated. Notably, it highlights the
          ebbs and floors of how gaze is collected and released during this sequence of interaction. For example, around
          the 5s mark, it becomes clear that all the students begin looking at the center of the classroom or
          experiment, as opposed to many different directions observed earlier. Most students look at the teacher,
          whereas the teacher’s gaze fluctuates between students. Those sitting away from the teacher seem to focus
          their gaze on the teacher, whereas those sitting next to her seem to look at other students. This pattern
          repeats across the two minute sequence of interaction in response to how the teacher gathers and releases
          attention through her gesture and talk.
