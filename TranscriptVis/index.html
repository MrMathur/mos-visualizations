        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p> The second visualization is a bubble chart, where each ellipse represents a conversation turn (i.e., in this
          case, uninterrupted speech that could span multiple sentences) spoken by either the teacher or a student.
          Ellipses are organized across a conventional timeline or time series display and the beginning and end (or
          left and right) of each ellipse marks the beginning and end of each conversation turn. Moreover, the
          visualization supports user interaction by allowing users to toggle between rectangles and ellipses to
          represent conversation turns, which allow users to explore subtly different aspects of conversation structure
          from this sequence of interaction. The users can also hover on a conversation turn (ellipse or rectangle), to
          display and read the dialogue spoken.</p>

        <h2>Encoding Decisions</h2>
        <p> A database was generated with each conversation turn, its content, and who spoke each conversation turn.
          Notably, each conversation turn was defined as a sequence of uninterrupted speech, which could span over
          multiple sentences. With the database in place, a bubble chart was made. The height of the ellipse indicates
          the number of words in each conversation turn. Thus, taller ellipses or rectangles (depending on the view
          selected by the user) indicate more words spoken during a conversation turn or a faster conversation turn. The
          left and right of each ellipse or rectangle indicate the beginning and end of each conversation turn. Thus,
          where ellipses or rectangles overlap indicates overlapping speech. The color of the bubbles represents who
          made each conversation turn. Hovering on a bubble reveals the content of the dialogue.

        <h2>Insights Generated</h2>
        <p>The bubble chart reveals a number of relevant insights. First, one can observe the general pacing of each
          conversation turn (i.e., length of conversation turns with respect to both the number of words and amount of
          time). This makes visible how the teacher speaks for much longer stretches of time and the parts of this
          interaction where students speak for long periods of time, often while asking a question. Likewise, the
          moments during this interaction when no one is speaking can be quickly identified. Moreover, overlapping
          ellipses (or rectangles depending on the view selected) are an interesting phenomenon. For example, these
          overlaps show that while students speak over one another they do not speak over or interrupt the teacherâ€™s
          speech. Furthermore, the teacher utters many more words per conversation turn in comparison to students, who
          generally speak fewer words and for shorter periods of time. Finally, the ability to quickly hover over each
          ellipse or rectangle and read conversation provides a fundamentally different way to compare and contrast
          conversation turns in comparison to existing transcription methods.
